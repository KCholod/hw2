Using the `Boston` data set from the library `MASS`, fit classification models in order to predict whether a given town has a crime rate above or below the median.

(a) Split the data into training and test set.


(b) Fit a logisitic regression using the training set to predict the probability that a given town has a crime rate above or below the median.


(c) Calucate the misclassification rate, sensitivity and specificity of the model in predicting the test set.


(d) Draw an ROC curve and calculate the value of AUC.
