In this exercise, we will predict the number of applications received using the other
variables in the \texttt{College} dataset.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ISLR)
head(College)
```


(a) Split the dataset into a training set and a test test (of roughly equal size). Fit a linear model
    using least
    squares on the training set, and report the prediction error on the test set.


(b) Use 10-fold cross-validation to estimate the prediction error (on the whole dataset).
    Compare to that of part (a). 
    
    
(c) Comment on the bias and variance of the prediction errors of (a) and (b).
